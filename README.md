## Front end developer environment

Automates the configuration of the front end developer environment using Vagrant and Ansible. 

Essentially, this process builds a Java web application from source (which acts as the local developers back end), installs and configures Apache, Tomcat, MongoDB, create and configure files/folders. 

This sets up front end developers to update the back end quickly and easily, and enables app development.
